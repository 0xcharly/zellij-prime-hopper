**Zellij Plugin for Fuzzy Directory Search and Session Switching**

zellij-prime-hopper is a Zellij plugin inspired by Primeagen's sessionizer script. It allows you to:

*   **Quickly search** through your existing Zellij sessions by directory name using fuzzy matching.
*   **Open a new session** with the currently selected directory as the working directory.
*   **Switch to an existing session** where the working directory matches the selected directory.

This plugin makes it easy to navigate your project directories and manage multiple Zellij sessions with ease.
